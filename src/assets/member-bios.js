          Hi, I’m David.
        </strong>
        <p>
          <strong style={{ fontSize: "var(--mFontSize)" }}>Racing</strong> in
          the U.S. since 2011, and vegan since 2015. I’m super excited about our
          team, being the first and so far only vegan cycling team in the U.S. I
          love our different approach to the whole ‘cycling-team’ aspect with a
          better focus, or more holistic approach to partnerships instead of
          sponsorships. To me ‘holistic’ is a keyword as I think when we’re
          trying to improve our fitness, only a holistic approach makes sense.
          Besides training, one should look at recovery, sleep, mental stress,
          social life and diet as well, as in my opinion, these are all
          influencing each other. If you want to achieve peak performance they
          are as equally important as the training sessions itself.
        </p>

          Therefore I adopted a plant-based vegan diet in 2015. Even before, I
          was never a big meat-eater, but did notice that when stage-racing, a
          vegan diet helped me recover faster. I felt better and fresher the
          next day than when eating meat. Why did I not switch to a fully vegan
          diet earlier? I had the same concern many people have: I would not get
          enough protein.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I was not a stereotypical male who had to eat steak because it’s soo
          delicious, and to prove my masculinity – far from it. I don’t think a
          guy is serious when he claims how good the steak was, especially when
          followed up with a scotch and a cigar… ;) But I can’t deny that I was
          probably also brainwashed to believe protein is key to athletic
          success.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          What made me change? Rich Roll’s podcast with David Carter (the
          300-pound vegan), and my partner at the time, as we were looking into
          adopting a fully plant-based vegan diet together. I thought, if David
          Carter can maintain 300 pounds on a vegan diet, little David Baar
          shouldn’t have any trouble doing it as a cyclist as well. In addition,
          I believe it was in one of Rich’s podcasts as well, someone posed the
          question “when was the last time you heard of someone in a developed
          country being admitted to hospital with a protein deficiency?”
          implying that probably those not conscious of what they eat, still eat
          plenty of protein. Ergo, I was brainwashed. And once we questioned
          common beliefs, we did more research and soon were convinced veganism
          is the way to go.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In terms of cycling, my recovery time between training and racing was
          significantly reduced allowing me to train more intensely more
          frequently. My favorite terrain are mountains, even though I’m not a
          mountain goat like James. In races, I also like to go for the ‘stupid’
          moves – it’s more fun, even though the reward is mostly a ‘getting
          dropped on lap x’. Like for many of us, 2020 has been a rollercoaster
          for me as well. One of the ‘ups’ was certainly getting into MTBiking
          over the summer, and I am super excited to try out XC and marathon
          racing in 2021. It seems like a completely different world which is
          fun to explore and learn! Btw, any vegan MTBikers out there?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          My favorite vegan dish is a raw Thai coleslaw recipe. I typically add
          either lentils, or beans, or even Tempeh, plus baked sweet potatoes. I
          know it won’t be a raw dish anymore, but it’s delicious and provides
          you with everything after a hard training ride. Otherwise Taylor is a
          fantastic cook, no matter what he cooks. Team meetings at his place
          are always a guarantee for delicious food. Oh yeah, and home-made rice
          cakes for bike rides, can’t get any better than that!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Anyway, going back to the excitement about the team – I can’t wait to
          see how our team develops in 2021 and beyond! Some exciting things are
          in the works!

          <strong style={{ fontSize: "var(--mFontSize)" }}>This </strong> would
          be a typical example of “what I eat in a day” throughout my late teens
          and early twenties as an aspiring powerlifter. At 17 years old, I
          became tired of being a 130lb golfer that could barely do a proper
          pull up and became enamored with reading nutrition journals and
          weightlifting magazines. In college, I joined a nutrition research lab
          and became meticulous with counting how many ounces of meat I needed
          to eat in a day to make sure I had the “optimal” amount of protein.
          Over the next 6 years, I gained nearly 55 pounds during my
          powerlifting and olympic weightlifting pursuits. However, after a knee
          injury at age 23, I took up cycling to try and stave off muscle
          atrophy in my lower body. Little did I know I would get hooked and
          cycling became my new fitness pursuit, on the complete opposite end of
          the spectrum of weightlifting.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After several years of cycling and still believing I needed a large
          amount of protein - from meat - to recover, I finally started to open
          my mind after seeing several cycling teammates perform and recover on
          a vegan diet. As I started looking into the research and watching a
          few documentaries, I began to start asking myself questions:
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              Would it be possible for me to recover better and feel lighter on
              the bike?
            </li>
            <li>
              How could I justify my “need” for animal products over the
              negative impacts animal agriculture has on the environment?
            </li>
            <li>
              How long could I really ignore the atrocities of factory farming,
              including the impact on communities living near factory farms?
            </li>
            <li>
              Should I really be eating eggs, steak, and bacon when my father
              and both grandfathers had heart attacks?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided that I really did not have any reason to continue my
          previous lifestyle of excess and indulgent consumption of animal
          products and cut out all animal products immediately. After 3 years of
          a vegan diet, I have often had others ask: “do you ever see yourself
          going back to a non-vegan diet?”. Not only is the answer “no”, but I
          don’t see any reason why I would go back. I feel better than I ever
          have and my blood markers indicate I am healthier and at lower risk of
          heart disease than in the past. I am considerably faster on the bike,
          have made the biggest improvements in my fitness after going vegan,
          and I recover quicker from hard training days than I used to. I feel
          like I am living in alignment with my values of compassion for others
          and care for the environment.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Every day I look forward to trying to make an impact with my decisions
          as I believe the future depends on people living a life that is
          compassionate towards others and minimizing the impact on the world we
          live in. In the meantime, I will be enjoying riding my bike fast,
          powered by plants!

          This is how my wife tells our friends that ask about when I made the
          move to a fully plant based diet. I’m a 35 year old male living in Los
          Angeles. In October 2019, while my wife was napping, I watched a
          documentary on Netflix, Game Changers, and have been plant based
          since. What this documentary did for me was dispel the myth that to be
          a great athlete you need to eat animal protein and presented an
          alternate reality to consider; that being plant based would actually
          make me a better athlete than if I was eating animals. I was willing
          to try and cut out all animal based products immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have been an athlete my entire life. I was the US National Champion
          at Tetrathlon (Modern Pentathlon without fencing) when I was 12,
          played Division 1 and professional Lacrosse as well as many other
          team, individual, and mountain sports. While I still play lacrosse
          recreationally, I was riding my bikes 100-300 miles per week as my
          primary sport. I was eating a lot of food to fuel these rides and
          activities. I became really focused on how to best fuel and recover,
          but being plant based was not something I even considered. When I
          tried being plant based, Strava and TrainingPeaks made it immediately
          clear that this lifestyle was right for me - I had personal records on
          everything across the board. However, it was hard to figure out what
          to eat at first and it took a lot of research and trial and error to
          find the best food for fuel. There are so many good resources now -
          Rich Roll and Matt Frazier are two of my favorites. They can both help
          with the ins and outs of supplementation and being a plant based
          athlete - B12 is a must.
        </p>
        <p>
          Becoming plant based is one part of my journey to live with intention
          and purpose as an athlete and a human. I want to be aware of how my
          actions affect me and my immediate and extended surroundings. The
          effect on me as an athlete is clear, but I’ve become much more aware
          of the effect the livestock industry has on the planet - it’s not
          sustainable. It’s also difficult to ignore the conditions animals
          endure during their short existences that are for the sole purpose of
          pleasing the human palate. Beyond these two ideas, there is a growing
          body of evidence that consuming animals, particularly in the
          quantities typical to a diet in the United States, is highly
          correlated to many diseases and ailments. If you are struggling with
          your health or looking to improve your athletic performance, try it. I
          don’t push being vegan on anyone and feel that everyone needs to find
          their own path and motivations. However, I’m grateful that I feel able
          to be the best I can be as an athlete and a force for good with my
          actions and consumer choices for the planet and the lives of the other
          creatures we share it with.

          I’ve been riding bikes since 2008. First commuting out of necessity,
          but eventually for fun once I found friends to ride with and
          discovered the joys and health benefits of cycling. My journey into a

          Hi, I'm James, and I got into cycling as a sport because I’m hopelessly
          competitive.
        </strong>
        <br />
        <p>
          My highschool friend Taylor (who is now my teammate) got a road bike
          and told me that he rode it from one side of town to the other in
          about 20 minutes - my first thought was, “That’s wild! I wonder if I
          could do it faster...” From there we shared a rivalry that sank us
          both deeper into the sport, especially when Strava got big. We fought
          over all the KOMs in our area, and when we eventually both moved to
          LA, we trained tirelessly just to try to get on the leaderboards. That
          eventually led us to group rides, which then led to racing, which we
          both seemed to be pretty decent at.
        </p>
        <p>
          We raced a long time as an unattached duo, and got some good results
          along the way, but we eventually decided it was time to get ourselves
          on a team; if for no other reason than to see what it was like racing
          with real team tactics. We joined team PBS (Portland Bicycle Studio)
          where we met Herr David Baar, our current captain and all around good
          egg. We raced for PBS for about a season, after which the team sponsor
          dropped out. But we’d had a great time, and towards the end of that
          season, I mentioned to David that I was considering going vegan, at
          which point he told me that he had been vegan for several years; we
          talked about it for hours, as I was hungry for stories about the
          subject. Veganism was a source of heated conversation amongst my
          friends, a vocal minority of which had been vegan for a couple of
          years as well. As a result of these recurring debates, I was already
          of the mind that a vegan diet was the more ethical way to live, but
          that still didn’t seem to be enough for me to make the switch.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hate to admit it, but if I’m honest my tipping point was just
          selfish curiosity about how it might benefit my health and performance
          on the road. Very fortunately for me, I had the guidance and support
          of my already vegan housemate (also highschool friend, and current
          teammate) Josh, as well as David’s advice as an experienced vegan
          endurance athlete. As a result of their wisdom, I avoided many of the
          pitfalls a lot of new vegans fall into, and the results on the bike
          were obvious. I was lighter, I was snappier, and had better recovery.
          If those perceived differences weren’t enough, my power numbers and
          results spoke for themselves. I had a higher threshold power than
          ever, even with the weight loss, and I won more that season than I
          ever had prior.
        </p>
        <p>
          The PBS team folded right around the time I started going vegan,
          followed shortly by Taylor who I mentioned at the top. Though we were
          once again without a team, we of course still wanted to race together.
          Since at that point we had all gone vegan, David called us up and
          suggested the idea that we form a vegan racing team; it was a no
          brainer as soon as he said it out loud. We immediately started talking
          about how we’d do it. It was David’s idea that we would get
          ​partnerships r​ather than sponsorships so that instead of just
          getting money from some local business, we could champion the causes
          that we thought were worth supporting. Vegan Athletic was the first
          that came to mind since they were already a company we admired, but
          after that, we had to consider what kind of causes we all wanted to
          support. What was our mission as a team going to be? That question
          prompted us all to reconsider our reasons for going/being vegan. I
          like to think that all vegans have their own little pie chart of
          reasons for being such.
        </p>
        <p>
          For me it began with wanting to be healthier and faster, and as I
          learned, the sections of my chart representing environmentalism and
          then indignation against the practices of animal agriculture grew in
          proportion. But another reason started to take precedence for me
          during this process of consideration. If going vegan helped me -an
          already quite health conscious athlete- to feel better and be
          healthier in so many ways, what could it do for the people I knew that
          weren’t so healthy? I thought of my family and the difficulty they and
          others in the black community were having with obesity, heart disease,
          and diabetes, and how these things were so obviously (and provably)
          perpetuated and compounded by poor diet. I thought that if this kind
          of change in lifestyle could help me feel better, for them it would be
          a revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when I considered how I would actually go about getting through to
          those people, I realized there were a number of factors forming a kind
          of barrier to entry for them. First, where they lived there certainly
          wouldn’t be a Wholefoods anywhere nearby, and even if there was, they
          wouldn’t be spending $10 on a 2 pack of beyond meat burgers when the
          animal equivalent was a quarter of that cost. Of course, someone could
          go vegan without those kinds of meat replacement options, but not
          without going through a bit of a learning curve to do so. But before
          they even approach that step, there are the countless misconceptions
          about meat and dairy, and the comparative sufficiency of a plant-based
          diet that would have to be overcome. I started to consider how these
          misconceptions have been perpetuated by the food industry, whose
          interests lie in the continued sale of their cheapest (and
          incidentally least healthy) products.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long story short, I started to notice how the confluence of these
          factors worked to prevent a huge number of people -especially in the
          poorer communities that I knew- from living healthier lives. And there
          it was - I found the issue that really clicked for me. I wasn’t sure
          just how a bike racing team out of Santa Monica would help solve these
          problems, but I thought I could at least start by making myself proof
          positive that people don’t need animal products to have energy or
          strong bones or whatever else. Then maybe with time, the team could
          build enough of a presence to bring significant attention to
          organizations who were helping address the issues with access to
          healthier foods, or with the lack of education about diet. I know the
          other members of the team have their own vegan pie charts, and I fully
          support their chosen causes. As tightly knit as we are, we’re still a
          coalition of people with different backgrounds and motivations - but
          hopefully we can leverage that diversity to make some waves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, that’s how I started out just wanting to beat my friend up a
          hill, and ended up aspiring to become a vegan activist. The issues
          plaguing the world right now may have conspired to thwart those
          aspirations, but when bike racing is a thing again and people actually
          have time to worry about their habits instead of just surviving, we
          can get back to the task(s) at hand.
