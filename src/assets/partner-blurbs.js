        racing at Sea Otter in 2019. <br />

        A recent vegan himself, he saw us browsing through the vendor booths and
        couldn’t believe his eyes when he saw there was a vegan cycling team. He
        immediately offered to service and lube our bikes with his product, all
        the while regailing us with his story of going vegan at 50 years old,
        and how he hadn’t felt so good since he was 25.
        <br />
        <br />
        John is a man who does everything to the fullest - that’s true of both
        his dedication to veganism, and of the consideration he puts into his
        product. A chemical engineer by trade, he turned his knowledge towards
        the many and varied problems of chain lubricants. His line of aMTBer wax
        based lubricants have been keeping our collective drivetrains buttery
        smooth and silent since we met him.
        <br />
        <br />
        We are proud to represent both a great guy, and a great product with
        aMTBer.
